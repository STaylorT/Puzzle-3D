# Shape Case
## Checkpoint
### Credits
Sean Taylor Thomas is the author of the code. No assets were used outside the basic Unity tools. I used blender to import one small piece for the finishing platform.
### Puzzle Intuition
How to make progress? You see the floating cubes and try to retreive them, but they just reappear..
Except for one! One is spinning slightly faster and spinning the opposite direction. When this one is retreived, it removes gravity for the barriers and allows you to either fall to your death, or have some faith in the arrow of cubes.

Wasn't able to inject a lot of clever spunk in this iteration. But made good progress for fading in/out and showing text/making buttons. Got caught up with this side of things for a while. 

## future plans
<li>Create 3-5 more levels with epic puzzle concepts.</li>
<li>Create more aesthetically pleasing scene theme</li>
<li>Maybe tweak controls of ball, slightly annoying</li>
<li> add more button options. e.g. quit. </li>
